# IntrotoProg-Python-Module08
Introduction to programming in Python module 8 assignment: Classes and objects

# Files
This repository includes two files:
 - Assignment08-Starter.py includes the code created for module 8
 - product_inventory.dat is a starter product list and used to pickle/unpickle changes to our list of objects

# Purpose
The purpose of this code is to create a list of objects for the user to manage their product inventory.

# Code Overview
The program begins by opening a pickle file with a product inventory.  If there is an error, the program assumes that a new product inventory list needs to be created. The user then uses numeric menu options to decide if they want to view inventory, add products, edit product prices, remove products, save the inventory, or exit.  What makes this program different from previous versions of the inventory program is that we are using a list of objects instead of tuples and sub-lists.

# Classes and Objects
In this module I created a list of objects in the class Product to manage my inventory.  The biggest advantages to using objects are:
 - You can create methods, similar to functions, for your class that allow you to change object properties without having to pass them in and out of the function as variables
 - Object properties are identified by name, e.g. price, instead of index number so you don't have to worry about ordering them or remembering the indices
For this program, I created the class Product.

### Figure 1: Create class Product for our objects

The class Product includes two methods that require an object to execute on.  The function __init__ creates an object with the parameters name and price.  The function __repr__ is another standard class method that uses object parameters to create a display name representing your object.

# Input and Output Functions
After product, I created the class IO (Input/Output) used in previous modules for functions that display information or check user input.  They are all listed as @staticmethod becuase while I might use objects and their parameters, I am not transforming the objects.  The first IO function, print_list_of_projects, immediately shows the difference between lists of objects and lists of lists/arrays/tuples.  Instead of pulling out individual class parameters and creating a custom string within the function, I print the display name generated by __repr__.

![Print list of objects](https://github.com/AFolmer/IntrotoProg-Python-Module08/assets/132308533/0a338461-4bcc-44c4-971b-7d8da453bfb7)
### Figure 3: Function to print a list of objects using __repr__ method

The objects in Product class have two parameters: name and price.  To ensure that users enter valid values, I created a function for each.  The function to check user input to the name parameter, enter_product_name, uses a while loop to let the user keep entering names until they get one right.  There is then a try/except/else tree to make sure that the user enters a string, then an if/elif/else tree to check if the product name is alredy in the inventory, less than 51 characters, and not a number.  The subsequent enter_product_price function follows a similar path to check that user entered prices is a 2 decimal float greatern than $0.

### Figure 4: Function to ensure that user enters a valid product name

# Main Body of Program
The main body of the program follows the same path as previous versions of inventory, but using pickle and objects instead of text files and lists of lists/dictionaries/tuples/etc.  Step one is to try and open a pickle file with the list lstOfProductObjects.  If the program encounters an error, the try/except tree instructs it to create a new list for us to edit and save and notify the user that they do not have any products in inventory.

### Figure 5: Try/except to open pickle file with inventory list or create a new list

Next, the program prints the menu of options and lets the user know to press 7 if they want to see the menu again.  Option 1 prints the list of products using the function print_list_of_products in Figure 3. Option 2 to add a new product is very similar to what we've done before.  The program captures user inputs for product_name and product_price using the IO functions in Figure 4 and then creates a new product to append to the list lstOfProductObjects on line 205.

### Figure 6: Create new object in class Product and append to list

In this program, once a product is created the user is allowed to update the paramer price.  To do this I created the function product_in_inventory (also used in enter_product_name) to use a for loop to check and see if the user entered name is in the list of objects and return the answer plus the object index number in the list.

![Find object in list of objects](https://github.com/AFolmer/IntrotoProg-Python-Module08/assets/132308533/647a9982-9031-4936-b891-2e24e6ea8e04)
### Figure 7: Check to see if object is in inventory and return index

Next, the program updates the object parameter price in the class Product using the variable obj_index to designate which object in the list to update (line 217.  This block finishes by printing the updated object display name using the __repr__ function from Figure 2.

![Try except and if else to update parameter of object in list](https://github.com/AFolmer/IntrotoProg-Python-Module08/assets/132308533/0d09178b-ffc8-4dcb-8a8e-7d4b1c75474e)
### Figure 8: Try except, if else, and object index to update object parameter price

To remove a Product object from the inventory, I used the product_in_inventory function in Figure 7 to find the product in the inventory list, obj_index, and then the python pop() function to remove the object at the value stored by obj_index (line 233).

![Pop() function to remove object form list based on index number](https://github.com/AFolmer/IntrotoProg-Python-Module08/assets/132308533/60aa42fc-964c-466d-bfc1-c8d3959675b7)
### Figure 9: Pop() function to remove object from list using index number

Finally, the program pickles the list of product objects and saves as a dat file.

### Figure 10: Pickle and save inventory list of Product objects

# Conclusion
In this module I built on earlier programs with lists, exceptions, and pickles to create a new version of product inventory using objects.  Going forward, objects will be a useful way to work with items that have many parameters associated with them or benefit from using complex formulas where passing multiple attributes in and out of a function will be easier using a method.
